The objective of this report is to register the overall steps of every model trained during the challenge of Fraud Detection offer by the Tera and NVidia.

## Models

All pickle files with the models can be find on `models` directory, accessing the [github of the project](https://github.com/LucianoBatista/fraud-detection-classifier).

I'm using the following convention for name the pickle files:

- `{date_start_training}{model}v_{ordinal_number_qtt_trained_that_date}.sav`
